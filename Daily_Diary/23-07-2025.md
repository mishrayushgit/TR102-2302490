## Objectives

- Integrate sentiment, emotion, and hate speech analysis for each content type (post, comment, reply).
- Improve UI by visually representing sentiment with color-coded bars.
- Continue enhancing the Top 5 content display components.

## Activities Performed

- Met with my mentor; received feedback to enhance textual content analysis with:
  - Sentiment classification (Positive, Neutral, Negative)
  - Emotion detection
  - Hate speech detection
- These analyses were already implemented by sir and stored in the `text_analysis_collections` collection.
- I retrieved this data and integrated it with the popup cards of each:
  - **Post**
  - **Comment**
  - **Reply**
- Updated Top 5 content (posts, comments, replies) chart to include:
  - Sentiment color coding:
    - ðŸ”´ Red for Negative
    - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow for Neutral
    - ðŸŸ¢ Green for Positive


## Challenges Faced

- Mapping the preprocessed `text_analysis` results correctly to the original content entries.
- Ensuring the UI remains responsive with the added metadata and interactivity.
- Adjusting old data formats to include the new structure without breaking existing components.

## Learnings

- Learned how to utilize pre-analyzed text data from MongoDB efficiently.
- Understood the mapping logic for combining UI elements with NLP model outputs.
- Improved frontend design thinking by incorporating subtle but informative visual cues.

## Next Steps

- Apply the same UI integration and enhancements to **comments** and **replies**.
- Review data structure for optimization and consistency across all content types.
- Begin drafting the final project documentation and prepare GitHub repo structure.
