## Objectives
- Understand how to handle and process JSON data for a Reddit Data Dashboard.
- Learn to use the `reduce()` function on JSON object arrays for aggregation tasks.
- Design a visual layout (wireframe/mockup) of the Data Dashboard structure and components.

## Activities Performed
- Explored handling JSON data structures typically fetched from Reddit APIs.
- Studied how to use data aggregation operations like counting total comments, upvotes, and post types using JavaScript's `reduce()` function.
- Designed a visual layout plan for the Data Dashboard, deciding on chart types, metrics display cards, and data panels.
- Created a rough dashboard structure idea including components for:
  - Total Users
  - Total Posts
  - Total Comments
  - Monthly Post Counts (Bar Chart)
  - Top 5 Most Active Users
  - Post Type Distribution (Pie Chart)

## Challenges Faced
- Initially struggled with understanding how to navigate deeply nested JSON data structures from Reddit.
- Took time to conceptually grasp how `reduce()` can be applied to aggregate values from an array of objects.
- Needed to decide on an intuitive and clean dashboard layout that represents all necessary metrics without clutter.

## Learnings
- Gained theoretical knowledge on parsing and manipulating JSON data structures.
- Understood how the `reduce()` function works in JavaScript and how it can be used for counting, summing, and grouping values in arrays.
- Learned to plan a clear and user-friendly data dashboard layout for presenting social media analytics.

## Next Steps
- Begin coding and handling sample Reddit JSON data for practical aggregation.
- Implement data visualization using libraries like `Recharts.js` or `Chart.js`.
- Test the prototype layout with dummy data before integrating real or API-fetched data.
