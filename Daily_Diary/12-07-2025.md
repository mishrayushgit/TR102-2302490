## Objectives  

- Explore **PyMongo** further and understand more MongoDB-Python operations.
- Start learning about **NLTK**, **stopwords**, and **TF-IDF** techniques for text analysis.
- Plan next steps for developing the text preprocessing program.

## Activities Performed  

- Practiced and learned more about **PyMongo**: establishing connections, performing insert and find queries.
- Explored the **NLTK library**:
  - Understood what **stopwords** are and how to remove them from text.
  - Learned about **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** and its role in text analysis and word cloud generation.
- Drafted an outline for the upcoming Python text preprocessing program.

## Challenges Faced  

- Need to practice more MongoDB query structures in Python.
- Still getting comfortable with NLTK's different functions and modules.
- TF-IDF math feels a little tricky â€” need to revise its logic with examples.

## Learnings  

- Improved understanding of **PyMongo basic operations**.
- Learned how to use **NLTK's stopword list** and text tokenization.
- Got a conceptual grasp of how **TF-IDF** scoring works and how it helps in identifying important words.

## Next Steps  

- Write the **Python text preprocessing script**:
  - Fetch documents from the remote MongoDB server.
  - Clean text data (remove stopwords, punctuation, etc.).
  - Apply TF-IDF scoring to determine word importance.
  - Store processed data in the `wordcloud` collection.
- Test the script with sample data.
- Integrate the script with the backend workflow to serve word cloud data to the frontend.
