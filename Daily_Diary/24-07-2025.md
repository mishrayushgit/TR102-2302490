## Objectives

- Extend active user tracking by identifying the top 30 users per month.
- Integrate the top users data with a visual WordCloud.
- Trigger WordCloud popup when "Unique Users per Month" is clicked.
- Share complete project code with guide for review and transfer.

## Activities Performed

- Updated logic to fetch **Top 30 Active Users per Month** instead of just top 15.
- Displayed these users using a **WordCloud**:
  - Font size reflects user activity.
  - Activated on click of **"Unique Users per Month"** bar chart.
- Shared the **entire project codebase** (backend, frontend, and models) with my guide for review and handover.

## Challenges Faced

- Dynamically syncing chart clicks with WordCloud rendering.
- Ensuring code and dataset sharing was clean and well-organized.

## Learnings

- Learned how to visualize ranked user data in an engaging format.
- Understood how to properly package and share a complete codebase for external use.

## Next Steps

- Finalize deployment-related tasks in collaboration with the guide.
- Document project structure, setup steps, and code modules for GitHub and report.
- Begin writing the final technical documentation and conclusion section.
