### ðŸ“Œ Work Summary

- Met with my professor, who provided a brief about the next task for the internship.
- The task involves creating a simple data dashboard using random data statistics, which will later be connected to MongoDB.
- Started exploring how `Recharts.js` works, as it will be used to build the dashboard's charts and visualizations.
- No practical implementation or coding done yet â€” just learning and understanding the charting library's components and structure.
