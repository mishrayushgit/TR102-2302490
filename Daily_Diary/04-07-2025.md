## Objectives
- Develop the frontend layout for the Reddit Data Dashboard.
- Implement data visualization for **Unique Users Per Month** using an **Area Graph**.
- Process JSON data provided by a fellow intern to extract monthly metrics.
- Learn and apply iterative JavaScript functions (`forEach()`, `map()`, `reduce()`) for data shaping.

## Activities Performed
- Created the initial **frontend layout** using React and Tailwind CSS.
- Implemented two data visualization components:
  - **Posts Per Month** (Bar Chart)
  - **Unique Users Per Month** (Area Graph)
- Processed and molded JSON data to generate monthly-wise user and post counts.
- Integrated **Recharts.js** to display the Area Graph for unique users with a linear gradient fill.
- Styled the components and tested with sample dummy data.

## Challenges Faced
- Faced difficulty in shaping the nested JSON data into a structure suitable for Recharts components.
- Initially struggled with setting up the gradient fill and area chart responsiveness.
- Required careful iteration logic to extract unique users count month-wise.

## Learnings
- Understood how to process and restructure JSON data using JavaScript iterative functions.
- Learned to implement an **AreaChart** in `Recharts.js` with linear gradients and tooltips.
- Gained clarity on how frontend charts can be made responsive and cleanly styled with Tailwind CSS.
- Improved understanding of handling JSON data dynamically for frontend dashboard displays.

## Next Steps
- Develop remaining dashboard components:
  - **Total Users**
  - **Total Posts**
  - **Total Comments**
  - **Top 5 Most Active Users**
  - **Post Type Distribution (Pie Chart)**
- Set up a basic backend using Node.js and Express to serve the processed JSON data via API.
- Replace hardcoded dummy data with API-fetched data in the frontend.
- Implement basic error handling and loading states for API requests.
- Optimize chart responsiveness and consider adding data filters (e.g., date ranges, subreddit selection).
