## Objectives
- Understand how to push and retrieve data from a JSON file using Node.js.
- Learn to work with the `fs` (File System) module for reading files in a backend environment.
- Practice integrating JSON data with MongoDB using the MERN stack and Vite setup.

## Activities Performed
- Created a website that reads data from a JSON file using the `fs` module.
- Successfully pushed the JSON data into MongoDB and implemented functionality to retrieve it back.
- Practiced working with the MERN stack setup alongside Vite for faster development workflow.
- Understood how to handle file reading, parsing JSON, inserting data into a database, and displaying it on a frontend.

## Challenges Faced
- Initial confusion around reading JSON files asynchronously and ensuring data was correctly formatted before inserting into MongoDB.
- Minor issues while configuring Vite with the MERN stack setup.
- Managing CORS and asynchronous operations between backend and frontend during data retrieval.

## Learnings
- Gained practical knowledge of the `fs` module in Node.js for reading and working with files.
- Understood the workflow for inserting JSON data into MongoDB and retrieving it efficiently.
- Improved backend-to-database integration skills within a MERN environment using Vite.

## Next Steps
- Complete the task assigned by the mentor, due by Monday:
  - Load a provided JSON file (from a fellow intern) containing **Reddit data for a specific subreddit** into MongoDB.
  - Display statistical information fetched from MongoDB such as:
    - Number of posts â€” monthly and yearly distribution.
- Explore Recharts or similar libraries to visualize this Reddit statistical data on the frontend.
