## Objectives  

- Shift the website and database setup to professor’s system.
- Replace one area chart with a bar chart as suggested by professor.
- Receive and review new tasks:
  - Create a config file to store IP address information.
  - Convert the active users chart to a bar chart.
  - Run pretrained sentiment, emotion, and hate classification tasks on every 'TEXT' and store results in a new collection in the MongoDB server hosted on professor’s system.

## Activities Performed  

- Successfully shifted the website and database setup to professor’s system.
- Changed the specified area chart to a bar chart as instructed.
- Converted the active users chart to a bar chart as part of the new tasks.
- Collected and reviewed details for the upcoming tasks:
  - Plan to create a config file for storing IP addresses.
  - Understand the integration workflow for pretrained classification tasks on text fields.

## Challenges Faced  

- Minor adjustments needed while shifting the website to professor’s system to ensure backend connections and frontend links worked properly.

## Learnings  

- Learned how to migrate a full backend-frontend system to a different host machine.
- Gained experience modifying and switching between different chart types in the dashboard.
- Understood how to plan config management for system-specific variables like IP addresses.

## Next Steps  

- Create a config file to store IP address information.
- Integrate pretrained sentiment, emotion, and hate classification tasks.
- Run these classification models on every 'TEXT' field from the database.
- Store the classification results in a new collection on professor’s MongoDB server.
- Test and validate the classification outputs.
