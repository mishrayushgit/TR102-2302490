## Objectives

- Meet with sir to review project progress and receive new tasks.
- Understand the requirement for a Python-based backend preprocessing script.
- Revise Python programming fundamentals in preparation for upcoming tasks.
- Plan next steps for integrating Python scripts with MongoDB for text processing.


## Activities Performed

- Met with sir and discussed current subreddit dashboard implementation.
- Received a new task to:
  - Create a Python script that fetches data from MongoDB.
  - Perform text extraction and preprocessing on subreddit data (posts/comments/replies).
  - Store the processed text values back into a MongoDB collection so the API can directly serve preprocessed data to the frontend.
- Revised core Python concepts, focusing on:
  - Variables, data types, lists, tuples, dictionaries.
  - Loops and conditionals.
  - Functions and modules.
- Explored initial documentation and tutorials for **PyMongo** and **NLTK** libraries.


## Challenges Faced

- Lack of familiarity with **PyMongo** and **NLTK** libraries.
- Need to revise Python basics before moving to text processing and database interaction.
- Understanding MongoDB document structures and designing an appropriate schema for storing preprocessed data.


## Learnings

- Refreshed foundational Python knowledge for better preparedness.
- Understood the workflow of using Python scripts to interact with MongoDB.
- Recognized the role of text preprocessing libraries like **NLTK** in preparing data for analytics and visualizations.

## Next Steps

- Install and get comfortable with **PyMongo** for MongoDB data fetching and insertion.
- Learn **NLTK basics**: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization.
- Understand **TF-IDF** concepts and explore libraries like `sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer`.
- Write a prototype script to:
  - Fetch documents from MongoDB.
  - Extract and process text fields.
  - Save processed results back into a new or existing collection.
- Integrate this preprocessing script workflow into the project pipeline.
