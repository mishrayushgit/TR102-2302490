## Objectives
- Understand how to host a React application accessible by other devices on the same local network.
- Learn techniques to identify the IP address and properly configure network settings.
- Explore MongoDB hosting on a remote server for database accessibility.

## Activities Performed
- Used Windows networking commands such as `ipconfig` and `ping` to discover the local machine's IP address.
- Configured the React development server to accept connections from other devices by setting the host to `0.0.0.0`.
- Tested hosting the project via a mobile hotspot and successfully accessed it from other devices connected to the same network.
- Implemented changes in the project setup to support local network hosting.
- Explored and practiced hosting MongoDB on a remote server.

## Challenges Faced
- Understanding how local network IP addresses work and ensuring correct firewall and network permissions.
- Configuring the React development server for external device access while maintaining security.

## Learnings
- Gained practical knowledge on configuring development environments for local network accessibility.
- Improved understanding of network protocols and IP configurations relevant to hosting.
- Learned procedures for deploying MongoDB on a remote server to enable external connections.

## Next Steps
- Document the detailed steps for hosting the React app and MongoDB server within the local network.
- Explore web hosting options and deployment strategies for production environments.
