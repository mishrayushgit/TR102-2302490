## Objectives

- Integrate sentiment, emotion, and hate speech analysis for each content type.
- Improve UI by visually representing sentiment with color-coded bars.
- Continue working on top 5 content display.

## Activities Performed

- Met with my mentor; received feedback to include advanced text analysis:
  - Sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative)
  - Emotion detection
  - Hate speech detection
- Integrated these analyses for each **post**, along with existing metadata.
- Updated top 5 content (posts, comments, replies) display:
  - Each bar in the chart is now color-coded based on sentiment:
    - ðŸ”´ Red for Negative
    - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow for Neutral
    - ðŸŸ¢ Green for Positive
- Improved the visual presentation and user interactivity with cleaner sentiment cues.

## Challenges Faced

- Syncing the existing content structure with new sentiment fields.
- Managing performance for large-scale analysis across multiple documents.

## Learnings

- Gained hands-on experience with text classification models and their integration.
- Learned how to map sentiment labels to UI elements effectively.

## Next Steps

- Apply the same sentiment-emotion-hate integration to **comments** and **replies**.
- Optimize data handling and improve performance if needed.
- Prepare data and structure for final project report and GitHub documentation.
