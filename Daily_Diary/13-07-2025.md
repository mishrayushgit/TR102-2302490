## Objectives  

- Complete the **TF-IDF based text preprocessing program**.
- Store the processed word cloud data into the **`word_cloud_data` collection** in MongoDB.
- Update backend APIs to load word cloud data from the new collection.
- Plan meeting with professor to shift the website and database to his system.

## Activities Performed  

- Successfully wrote the **Python text preprocessing script** using TF-IDF.
  - Fetched documents from MongoDB.
  - Cleaned text by removing stopwords and punctuation.
  - Applied **TF-IDF scoring** to extract significant words.
  - Stored processed data into the **`word_cloud_data` collection**.
- Modified the backend code to load and serve word cloud data from the new collection to the frontend.
- Tested the full flow — from data processing to frontend word cloud display — and it worked as expected.

## Challenges Faced  

- Minor issues while integrating TF-IDF processed data structure with the existing API.
- Took some time to verify the data format consistency between backend and frontend components.

## Learnings  

- Gained hands-on experience implementing **TF-IDF with Scikit-learn**.
- Understood how to structure and store processed text data in MongoDB for frontend use.
- Improved knowledge in integrating **Python preprocessing scripts** with an existing backend workflow.

## Next Steps  

- Schedule a meeting with professor to:
  - Demonstrate the working word cloud feature.
  - Shift the entire website to his system for deployment.
- Clean up the backend code and add error handling around database connections and API responses.
- Optionally explore optimizing the word cloud generation for larger datasets.
