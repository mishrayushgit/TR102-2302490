## Objectives

- Resolve data inconsistency in monthly user charts caused by year mismatch.
- Conclude internship activities and receive final feedback from professor.

## Activities Performed

- Met with sir regarding a bug in the **Unique Users per Month** chart:
  - Some subreddits showed overlapping data from **older years (e.g., Nov to Jun)** along with 2025.
  - Cause: Aggregation grouped only by **month**, ignoring **year**.
- Fixed backend code to include both **month and year** in the aggregation pipeline.
- Now filtering and displaying only **2025 data**, ensuring clarity and accuracy.

## Internship Wrap-up

- **Successfully completed internship project.**
- **Shared the entire source code** of the project with sir.
- Received final review and appreciation for the work done.

## Guidance from Professor

- Sir encouraged preparation for **higher studies (Masters)**.
- Suggested exploring **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** further, as the project demonstrated interest and potential in the field.
- Advised to build on current work and look into **research or applied NLP areas** for future opportunities.

## Learnings

- Always include **year** in time-based visualizations to prevent confusion in multi-year datasets.
- Effective debugging of real-world data issues requires thorough edge case analysis.
- Feedback from mentors can provide valuable direction for future academic and career growth.

## Next Steps

- Begin researching **NLP specializations** and relevant master's programs.
- Document the full project.
