## Objectives
- Integrate **Top 5 Posts by Comments** graph on clicking a specific month from the **Comments Per Month** bar chart.
- Connect backend data for **Replies Per Month** and visualize it on the dashboard.
- Handle frontend state switching and conditional rendering to toggle between multiple chart types in the same graph space.
- Plan upcoming **statistics cards** to display subreddit-wise metrics like total posts, total comments, total replies, and top user.

## Activities Performed
- **Integrated dynamic click functionality** on the **Comments Per Month** bar graph to fetch and display **Top 5 Posts by Comments** for the selected month using the existing backend API.
- Connected **Replies Per Month** data endpoint from MongoDB and rendered it on the frontend Line chart.
- Implemented frontend state management to **toggle between multiple chart modes** (per month comments vs top 5 posts) within the same graph area.
- Adjusted bar click handlers and backend query routing to ensure smooth data loading and avoid undefined/null state errors when no data exists.
- Successfully tested all click transitions between **Comments Per Month** and **Top 5 Posts by Comments** for June and July 2025 sample data.
- Prototyped layout ideas for **subreddit statistics cards** to display total post count, comment count, reply count, and top user dynamically in a clean card interface.

## Challenges Faced
- Faced difficulty applying **multiple graphs in the same container** and conditionally rendering them based on user interaction without layout glitches.
- Needed careful handling of missing data cases (when no top 5 posts exist for a month) to avoid click handler failures.
- Managing frontend state between **Comments Per Month** and **Top 5 Posts** graphs without unnecessary component re-renders or data leaks was initially tricky.
- Slightly struggled reshaping reply data month-wise for bar graph rendering due to differing date structures.

## Learnings
- Improved on **conditional component rendering** and **state-driven dynamic graph updates** within React.
- Learned how to efficiently manage multiple datasets in a single chart area based on user interaction.
- Gained a better understanding of handling empty datasets and preventing UI breakdowns on unexpected API responses.
- Strengthened backend and frontend integration for multiple related collections (comments and replies).
- Enhanced data shaping skills for reply and comment aggregation.

## Next Steps
- Design and integrate **dashboard statistic cards** showing:
  - Total Posts
  - Total Comments
  - Total Replies
  - Top User per Subreddit
- Expand dummy and real data coverage to include more months for richer testing.
- Add basic loading states and error handling for each graph component.
- Optimize responsiveness and layout balancing as more components are added.
