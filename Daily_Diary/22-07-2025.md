## Objectives

- Generate top 15 active users per month for each subreddit.
- Continue documenting backend logic.
- Plan integration of top users into frontend.

## Activities Performed

- Developed a Python script to compute the top 15 active users per month for every subreddit.
  - Data pulled from MongoDB and grouped by subreddit and month.
  - Output formatted to support visual integration (e.g., word cloud).
- Updated documentation to explain:
  - The purpose and logic of the top users script.
  - How monthly grouping and frequency calculation works.

## Challenges Faced

- Making sure the monthly grouping aligns with how the frontend chart expects the data.
- Structuring the result for dynamic rendering in word cloud format.

## Learnings

- Improved skills in working with time-based data in MongoDB.
- Understood how to format backend results for dynamic frontend components like word clouds.

## Next Steps

- Integrate the top 15 users data into the frontend.
  - When a month is clicked on the "Unique Users per Month" chart, display a word cloud of top users for that month.
- Finalize documentation for all backend scripts.
- Begin learning model fine-tuning and deployment practices.
