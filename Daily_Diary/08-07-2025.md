## Objectives

- Implement backend changes based on the new unified collection model discussed previously.
- Combine all subreddit data (posts, comments, replies) into the single collection format.
- Develop the word cloud generation logic to aggregate and process data from the unified collection.
- Test the new backend endpoints to ensure proper integration with frontend components.

## Activities Performed

- Modified backend data models and APIs to work with the new unified **Posts-Comments-Replies** collection.
- Consolidated existing post, comment, and reply data into the new collection format following the schema designed on 07-07-2025.
- Implemented the word cloud generation script to compute TF-IDF scores across combined text data from the unified collection.
- Tested the word cloud API endpoint with different `type` parameters (post, comment, reply, all) to validate data accuracy.
- Integrated the updated backend with the frontend dashboard components to dynamically display word clouds based on user selection.
- Verified frontend state management and UI rendering for multiple word cloud types.

## Challenges Faced

- Ensuring data integrity while migrating from multiple collections to a unified collection.
- Handling large text volumes during TF-IDF computation efficiently without performance bottlenecks.
- Managing frontend state updates smoothly to reflect changes in selected word cloud types.
- Minor API response formatting issues during initial testing phase.

## Learnings

- Gained hands-on experience in refactoring backend data models to improve scalability and maintainability.
- Deepened understanding of dynamic data fetching in React and handling multiple data states for different content types.
- Improved skills in writing optimized aggregation and processing logic for text analytics (TF-IDF) on large datasets.
- Learned best practices for syncing backend changes with frontend components in real-time dashboards.

## Next Steps


- Learn and plan the configuration of the search button in the frontend.
- Implement integration of the search button with backend APIs.
- Develop API endpoints to connect the frontend search with MongoDB queries.
- Increase the volume of documents/data available for subreddits to improve search relevance and coverage.
