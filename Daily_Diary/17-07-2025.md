## Objectives  

- Finalize and run the emotion detection script and store results in `text_emotion_collection`.
- Ensure visual consistency by converting all charts to bar charts.
- Begin preparing documentation for website maintenance.
- Calculate sentiment for each post individually.
- Implement UI enhancements:
  - Color-coded sentiment bar chart (red-negative, yellow-neutral, green-positive).
  - Popup textbox showing user and time of post.
  - Word cloud with font size based on number of posts/comments/replies.

## Activities Performed  

- Completed the **emotion detection script** and ran it across the dataset:
  - Model classified and stored emotion labels along with post IDs in `text_emotion_collection`.
  - However, the script is slow — processing each document sequentially takes significant time and may need **GPU acceleration** for better performance.
- Converted **all charts to bar charts** on the dashboard for design consistency.
- Began working on the **website maintenance documentation layout** — structure is drafted; content will be developed alongside tasks.
- Implemented **individual sentiment calculation** for each post and stored the results.
- Reviewed remaining UI tasks for upcoming implementation.

## Challenges Faced  

- **Performance bottleneck** in the emotion detection script due to sequential processing.
- Lack of GPU makes real-time or large-scale inference slower.
- Documentation writing is in progress but not yet complete.

## Learnings  

- Understood limitations of CPU-bound inference with transformer models on large datasets.
- Improved frontend design by standardizing chart types.
- Learned to manage workload by progressing on documentation in parallel with code development.

## Next Steps  

- Optimize the script:
  - Consider batch processing or parallel execution.
  - Explore GPU options (Colab/local setup with CUDA).
- Continue writing the website maintenance documentation.
- Implement remaining UI tasks:
  - Color-coded sentiment bar chart.
  - Popup with user and post timestamp.
  - User word cloud with font size based on content activity.
- Schedule review session with professor for feedback.
