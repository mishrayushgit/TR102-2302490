## Objectives
- Build backend logic to fetch **Comments Per Month** data for the dashboard.
- Connect backend data for:
  - **Unique Users Per Month** (Area Chart)
  - **Posts Per Month** (Bar Chart)
  - **Comments Per Month** (Bar Graph)
- Process MongoDB JSON data to structure it into frontend-friendly formats.
- Write backend aggregation for **Top 5 Posts by Comments** per month.
- Optimize backend processing to minimize data shaping on the frontend.



## Activities Performed

-  **Completed full backend integration with MongoDB** for posts and comments.
- Connected backend data to existing frontend components:
  - **Unique Users Per Month** (Area Graph)
  - **Posts Per Month** (Bar Chart)
  - **Comments Per Month** (Bar Graph)
- Developed backend logic to:
  - Count total comments per month.
  - Fetch and shape the **Top 5 Posts by Comments** per month.
- Processed nested MongoDB JSON documents into chart-ready data structures using `reduce()` and `Object.entries()`.
- Tested all backend data endpoints with available dummy data for **June** and **July 2025**.
- Wrote optimized backend aggregation functions to reduce rendering time and avoid bulky frontend data transformations.



##  Challenges Faced

- Struggled initially with reshaping MongoDB documents into formats suitable for **Recharts** Bar Graph components.
- Needed precise iteration and date formatting logic to group comments by month and count them efficiently.
- Encountered minor hurdles adjusting gradient fills and making the area chart fully responsive yesterday, carried those learnings forward.



##  Learnings

- Learned to process and restructure JSON data for monthly comment counts with clean aggregation logic.
- Improved JavaScript iteration method skills (`forEach()`, `map()`, `reduce()`).
- Understood better strategies to handle MongoDB date formatting and aggregation on the backend.
- Strengthened grasp of backendâ€“frontend integration with React and Recharts.
- Improved backend route design for structured data delivery to React components.



##  Next Steps

- Integrate **Top 5 Posts by Comments** Bar Graph on the frontend.
- Add remaining dashboard components:
- Expand data coverage beyond **June** and **July 2025**.
- Add basic error handling and loading states for all frontend components.
- Optimize dashboard component responsiveness and consider adding data filters (e.g., date ranges, subreddit selector).
