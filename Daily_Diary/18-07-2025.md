## Objectives

- Write a script to classify emotions in all text data and store results.
- Visualize emotion classification in monthly bar charts using sentiment color coding.
- Prepare for implementing interactivity (clickable bars showing top 5 high-score content).

## Activities Performed

- Developed and executed a **script** that:
  - Processes each document.
  - Adds `label` (emotion type) and `index` (score index).
  - Stores results into `text_emotion_collection`.
  - The classification recognizes three emotion types: `positive`, `neutral`, and `negative`.

- Based on this classified data, updated the **monthly bar charts** (for posts, comments, and replies):
  - Converted all into stacked **bar charts**.
  - Applied color-coding:
    - ðŸ”´ Red for negative.
    - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow for neutral.
    - ðŸŸ¢ Green for positive.

- Emotion classification was **successfully implemented and visualized**.
- Planned next steps:
  - Make bar segments **clickable**.
  - On click, show a **popup card** displaying the **top 5 highest scored content** (posts/comments/replies) for the selected emotion and month.

## Challenges Faced

- Script is **slow** due to per-document processing â€” may need GPU optimization or multiprocessing.
- Emotion classification is **limited to three classes**, restricting granularity (can use sentiment one if needed).
- UI interactivity needs careful **state management and filtering logic**.

## Learnings

- Learned to map sentiment labels to UI components effectively.
- Strengthened understanding of how to use chart libraries for multi-series emotion display.
- Gained clarity on future UI enhancements involving interactivity and data filtering.

## Next Steps

- Implement chart **click interactivity**:
  - On clicking a sentiment segment in the chart:
    - Filter and display the **top 5 high-score posts/comments/replies** of that emotion and month.
    - Open a **popup card** showing the content, user, and timestamp.
- Continue performance optimization for emotion tagging.
- Finalize documentation layout and begin writing sections in parallel.
