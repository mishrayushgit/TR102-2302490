## ðŸ“Œ Objectives  

- Meet with professor to discuss MongoDB server setup and remote access.
- Learn how to connect to a remote MongoDB server over the IIT Ropar network.
- Update existing backend code to display data from the remote server on the local website.
- exploring PyMongo for Python-MongoDB interactions.
- Plan next steps for building a Python preprocessing script for word cloud generation.



## ðŸ“Œ Activities Performed  

- Met with professor and received the remote MongoDB server connection string hosted on his system.
- Successfully learned how to connect to a **remote MongoDB server** using the provided connection URI within the IIT Ropar network.
- Made modifications to the existing **backend code** to fetch and display data from the remote MongoDB server on my local website.
- Experimented with **PyMongo basics** â€” understood how to establish connections, fetch data, and test initial queries.
- Discussed and planned the structure of a Python script that:
  - Retrieves documents (posts/comments/replies) from MongoDB.
  - Processes and cleans the text data.
  - Stores the processed text into a **`wordcloud` collection** in the database.
  - Enables the backend to directly serve processed word cloud data to the frontend via API.



## ðŸ“Œ Challenges Faced  

- Initially faced difficulty understanding how remote database connections work and how to properly configure the connection string.
- Had to carefully adjust backend code to switch from a local MongoDB instance to the remote server without breaking API endpoints.
- Need to strengthen knowledge on text preprocessing workflows and MongoDB-Python data handling.



## ðŸ“Œ Learnings  

- Understood how remote MongoDB connections are established using network-specific connection strings.
- Learned to modify backend APIs to fetch data from a different MongoDB instance.
- Gained initial experience with **PyMongo** for Python-based database operations.
- Clarified the upcoming pipeline for text preprocessing and word cloud generation.



## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps  

- Deepen understanding of **PyMongo** and MongoDB query operations using Python.
- Learn about **NLTK** and **TF-IDF** methods for better text analysis.
- Begin writing the **Python preprocessing script**:
  - Fetch data from the remote MongoDB.
  - Process text fields (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).
  - Store the processed data in the `wordcloud` collection.
- Integrate this script into the project workflow, enabling the backend to serve word cloud data directly to the frontend.
