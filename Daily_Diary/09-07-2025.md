## Objectives

- Add frontend search functionality to dynamically fetch subreddit-specific data.
- Learn and implement query parameter handling in API routes.
- Modify backend API endpoints to process subreddit names received from frontend queries.
- Integrate backend query-based APIs with the frontend dashboard components.
- Ensure dynamic updates of dashboard charts and word clouds based on searched subreddit.

## Activities Performed

- Developed the **subreddit search input field** in the React frontend.
- Implemented `onKeyDown` event listeners to trigger API calls when the `Enter` key is pressed.
- Modified backend Express routes and controllers to accept subreddit names via query parameters.
- Updated MongoDB query logic to fetch filtered data based on subreddit parameter values.
- Refactored existing backend APIs for **Posts**, **Comments**, **Replies**, and **Wordcloud** endpoints to respond dynamically for searched subreddits.
- Integrated search feature with all frontend dashboard components â€” including area charts, bar charts, line charts, stat cards, and word clouds.
- Validated frontend state management for smoothly updating data across components on subreddit change.
- Fixed handling for empty or non-existent subreddit queries to display a cleared dashboard or fallback state gracefully.

## Challenges Faced

- Managing multiple API endpoints and ensuring query consistency across all routes.
- Handling canvas clearing and state resets in the frontend word cloud component for empty or invalid subreddit searches.
- Debugging asynchronous fetch calls and ensuring state updates happen synchronously across interconnected components.
- Dealing with MongoDB query edge cases for non-existent subreddit values without breaking API responses.

## Learnings

- Understood how to send **dynamic query parameters in API calls** from React to Express backend.
- Improved understanding of **React event handling (onKeyDown)** for triggering API actions.
- Learned effective patterns for refactoring and generalizing backend APIs to support flexible query parameters.
- Gained experience in integrating frontend search workflows with backend filtering logic.
- Practiced clean state management and UI updates in React dashboards on API data changes.

## Next Steps

- Optimize MongoDB query performance for large subreddit datasets.
- Implement a **dropdown suggestion list** for subreddit names while typing.
- Add a fallback "No data found" component when an invalid subreddit is searched.
- Further modularize API controller logic for cleaner code maintenance.
- Expand word cloud analytics to show additional metadata (e.g., most frequent words, average comment length).
